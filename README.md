## Hello anyone, who decided to check my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm kinda *new* to GitHub, but I hope, by the time you read this, there will already be some

***AWESOME NEW*** projects and repos on my profile.

If not then oh well Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯...


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Neural Network development and other AI thingamajigs.
- ðŸ‡¨âœšâœš Right now I'm probably most proficient in c++, but python (*unfortunatelly or not*) is catching up.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on really any fun little project. Can't think of anything to do myself :/. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: probably gmail, but I wouldn't get your hopes up on receiving an answer: goosegras04@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite animals are owls and foxes ðŸ¦‰ðŸ¦Š
